/**
 * <pre>
 * NOTE: I once asked whether the name of Ex4 is Counter or Counting, but no one told me the answer. So I don't want to lose my mark because the file name is incorrect.
 * The Problems in This Code:
 * <p>
 * 1. Each case in switch is not independent. After executing a certain case, the remaining cases will be executed sequentially.
 * <p>
 * 2. When enter a illegal value(not 1 2 3 4 5), s.next(p12345) throw an InputMismatchException. So, it must be caught. 
 * And then doing Exception handling, must clean the buffer in Scanner.next by using s.next(). 
 * And due to this Exception, we cannot enter the default case forever, I delete the default case.
 * <p>
 * 3. When the loop is end, must close the Scanner.
 * <p>
 * 4. In those methods(add, subtract, set) with parameter Scanner s, when catch the NumberFormatException should use the method itself again(iterative call) to re-enter the right value instead of new Scanner again.
 * </pre>
 * The class is used in order to interactively count a number of
 * persons/items in a room, storeroom, etc. A user is able to select
 * between five options:
 * <pre>
 * 1. add to the counter,
 * 2. subtract from the counter,
 * 3. show the counter,
 * 4. set the counter to a new value, and
 * 5. exit the program.
 * </pre>
